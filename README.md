## Description

Motivation for the project was to learn how to interacdt with API'S.  Why did I build the project? I saw it in a list of possible projects to do and I thought it would be an interesting one to do.  The problem that it solved was, it makes a convienent way of looking at a 5 day weather forcast for a city you want to know about, which could come in handy when preparing for a trip.  I learned tow to deploy an app on render and how to interact with an external api.
